<p> Hello my name is Peter Kim and a few things 
    about myself is that I like to sing and play 
    soccer. To sing, I usually go to jaguar karaoke 
    to blow off steam from all school related activities. 
    Otherwise, I enjoy playing soccer either by myself or with
    a ucb soccer clubs at Berkeley High. My life is very simple and
    nothing too peculiar about it. Thanks and nice to meet you.</p>

<ul> 
    <li>1. Something that I learned from this article is to observe each and 
    every app that we use in an everyday basis. From observing these apps, I 
        would be able to detect the designer's skill and intent when it comes 
        to creating the hierarchy, content, and audience of the product. Lastly,
        I was able to easily understand what the author meant by breaking down
        the app due to useful images to show where to focus on when I open an app.</li>
    <li>2. My favorite part of this article was the section where the author 
        introduced a part saying "Know the rules, so you can break em". It almost 
        opened my eyes to becoming more aware of designs in the app that make it 
        compelling for users to easily access. </li>
    <li>3. "Next time you're sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think 
        through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way."</li>
    <li>4. 10/10</li>
